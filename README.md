Someone please steal this startup idea because I won't have time for it : Create an organization which lobbies for airline-like regulations created into real laws.. that is that uber/lyft/sidecar should be forced to behave like the airlines. If a Lyft custom cannot get a ride from a Lyft driver -- Lyft should subcontract Uber, or Sidecar if they have a driver in the area that is available. There is many advantages to this which I will not dive into now..
The on-demand marketplace should be regulated similarly to how the SEC regulates the NYSE for example -- reference implementations, trusted code with oversight. ... the product I envision (as a software engineer myself).. which would go hand in hand with the laws which the lobbyists in your organization would be creating -- it would be an app which for all intents and purposes that behaves like uber .. but have a market for different companies to produce competing softwares which support the drivers ease of use with the on-demand (regulated market)... this app would allow you to accept one and one ride only from a plethora of markets (with customers) one market is uber, one market is lyft, one market is sidecar, one market is cabs.. you get the idea.. if you are licensed/approved with any of above markets, you should be able to be plugged into a regulated on-demand marketplace where you receive only one piece of work at a time, but can leverage all potential work from all potential platforms.. also this fixes the pool problem.. you need ALOT of fucking rides going on before uberpool even makes financial sense for uber... if you overlay all the activity of lyft/uber/sidecar don't you think that would make for some pretty crazy optimized pool situations?
SO PLEASE -- someone steal this idea, raise money, and do it. it will happen no matter what, it is only a matter of time -- but you could make it happen in 5 years instead of 25.
